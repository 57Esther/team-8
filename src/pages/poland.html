                The tradition of celebrating New Year's Eve and welcoming the
                New Year in Poland is only short. Until the second half of the
                19th century, there were no lavish New Year's Eve balls, dances
                or even New Year's toasts. The New Year was welcome in big
                cities and wealthy homes. In the countryside, the last day of
                the year had no important significance - the important
                celebration was Christmas.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                In the past, New Year was celebrated mainly in cities. In Warsaw
                - with a cannon salute, in Krakow - with the ringing of the
                Sigismund bell on Wawel.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                Depending on the region of Poland, there were large lunches or
                New Year's Eve dinners where the whole family and friends met.
                You could find generously seasoned peas with cabbage or sausage
                among those mentioned. Bread and homemade cake were significant
                symbols.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                In the 20th century, huge, lavish New Year's Eve balls were
                organized. They took place from a public office, regarding
                meetings or restaurants. Regular house parties were popular
                during the Polish People's Republic.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white">
                New Year's traditions included those characteristics of the
                winter solstice related to magic and fortune-telling. It can be
                used for hiding, cleaning the house, and looking out for a man
                as the first member of the household.

                The ancient city of Warsaw is certainly one of the most

                before!
                <br />
                One of the best places you could visit is the Old Town area.
                This is the liveliest spot around New Year’s when you can drink,
                dance, and make new friends with tourists and locals. Also,

                peak of the holiday season. It will be packed with people and
                will have live music as well as a spectacular NYE fireworks
                display.

                offer quite a lot for wandering tourists. It’s one of the most
                popular destinations for spending the “Sylwester” (this is how
                the locals refer to New Year’s Eve). This event is among the
                most important one for the people of Krakow, who celebrate it in
                a lively atmosphere with music concerts and spectacular
                performances.
                <br />

                is a picturesque town renowned for its stunning natural beauty
                and vibrant cultural heritage. As the year draws to a close,

                the snow-covered trails, accompanied by traditional music, warm
                drinks, and the invigorating mountain air. The evening
